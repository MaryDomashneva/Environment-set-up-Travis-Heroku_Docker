# Environment-set-up-Travis-Heroku_Docker

This a tutorial that covered set-up environment Travis CI - Heroku - Doker for Ruby on rails project.
Also, this tutorial will show how to overcome common difficulties that you can face during set-up.

## Part I. Set up.

### Travis CI

* Go to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and log in with your GitHub.
* Follow the instructions on Travis about how to set-up a new repository.
* Make sure, that in the root of your repository you have ```.travis.yml``` file.

#### .travis.yml

```
language: ruby
rvm:
- 2.5.0
script:
- bundle exec rspec spec
services:
- postgresql
before_install:
- gem install bundler ### this line is important to have for further operations with Heroku and docker
before_script:
- bin/rails db:create
- bin/rails db:migrate
deploy:
  provider: Heroku
  api_key:
    secure: ### HERE SHOULD BE YOUR KEYS (YOU CAN GET THEM BY TYPING IN TERMINAL $ setup heroku --force)
  app: maln-acebook
  on:
    repo: blarvin/TEAM-MALN-ACEBOOK ### YOUR REPO IS HERE
```
### Heroku

* Go to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) and make a free account
* We assume that you have Ruby installed

In your terminal (you should be in your repo):

* ```$ heroku login``` 
* ```$ heroku create```
* ```$ git push heroku master```
* ```$ heroku open```

On this stage, you should be able to see your app opened with Heroku. If you facing any difficulties you can every time see your logs and following debugging process: ```$ heroku logs --tail```

### Docker

* Go to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and make an account.
* Make sure that you have inside you repo following files:

#### docker-compose.yml

```
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      - ./tmp/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  web:
    build: .
    command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'
    volumes:
      - .:/maln-acebook
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

#### Dokerfile

```
FROM ruby:2.5.0
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs
RUN mkdir /maln-acebook
WORKDIR /maln-acebook
COPY Gemfile /maln-acebook/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /maln-acebook/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install
COPY . /maln-acebook

CMD bundle exec rackup --port=$PORT  #This is very important line. Do not forget to include it, otherwise, you docker would not find localhost
```
In configs:

#### database.yml

```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  username: postgres
  password:
  pool: 5

development:
  <<: *default
  database: pgapp_development
 Â localhost: db    #You need this line to build app with docker, but this lines should be deleted before you push to Github, otherwise, Travis would fail.
test:
<<: *default
database: pgapp_test
localhost: db     #You need this line to build app with docker, but this lines should be deleted before you push to Github, otherwise, Travis would fail.

production:
  <<: *default
  host: <%= ENV['DATABASE_HOST'] %>
  database: <%= ENV['DATABASE_NAME'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['DATABASE_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

### Deploy Heroku using Docker

In your terminal:

```
$ docker login
$ docker-compose run web bundle install

$ docker-compose run web rake db:create # create databases
$ docker-compose run web rake db:migrate # create tables
$ docker-compose run web rake db:seed # insert seed records

$ docker-compose up --build # go to localhost:3000/api/users in your browser or `curl localhost:3000/api/users`

$ docker-compose ls # to show current containers
$ docker-compose down # to stop the container
```

```
$ heroku container:login
$ heroku container:push web -a maln-acebook
```

## Part II. Difficulties.

#### CMD bundle exec rackup --port=$PORT

Basically, our first mistake is that we did not know that we should specify in Dockerfile which port it should use. At first, we were guessing and tried to change random lines of code in config to make it works. After we realized, that this approach would not work, we forced ourselves to go through proper debugging process:
* rais visibility --> using logs --> google errors --> discuss with pair partner if it makes sense to change this particular part of the code.
It helped us to go through process quickly and step by step we found riched a point where we can run our app locally with docker, but it was broken on Heroku. We could not figure out what went wrong and followed our agreement do not be stacked for a long time, and asked mentors for help.
Together we find out how to modify our config file and add line ```CMD bundle exec rackup --port=$PORT```.

#### Get rid-off pid files

If you have a mistake like ``` A server is already running. Check /maln-acebook/tmp/pids/server.pid.```. You should run following comands in your terminal:
* ```$ sudo rm tmp/pids/server.pid```
* ```$ docker-compose run web rake db:reset```
* ```$ docker-compose up --build```

#### Database issues

The relationship between Docker and Heroku require from you:
* Every time when you introducing a new ```gem``` to your app you have to run ```$ docker-compose run web bundle install```
* Every time you changing the logic in the database you need to drop heroku database:
1. ```$ heroku pg:reset DATABASE_URL -a maln-acebook``` and ```--confirm``` this comand
2. Get rid-off pids
3. ```$ heroku container:login```
4. ```$ heroku container:push web -a maln-acebook```
